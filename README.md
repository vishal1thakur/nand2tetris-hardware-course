Projects Overview:

Project 1:

- Understand basic logic gates, boolean logic, boolean functions, hardware
  simulation tool, multi-bit buses.
- 15 fundamental logic gates were created from scratch, using NAND as the
  building block in hdl.

Project 2:

- Understand binary numbers, addition, half adder, full adder, multi adder,
  add16
- Using the gates created in project 1, hdls for half adder, full adder, add16,
  inc16 were created which combined into a ALU.
